# RSS Project
This project was created during a Scripting Languages course taught at my uni. It's purpose (for now) is to print the top 5 stories from a given RSS feed. I plan on expanding this project a bit more to include some additional functionality and ease-of-use. Stay tuned! -V

# Prereqs
This project uses the "feedparser" module to analyze and format feed data (.xml) for human eyes.

You can install feedparser with pip by running the following command:
```markdown
pip3 install feedparser
```

# Usage
To use the program with a custom URL:
```markdown
python rss_project.py [URL]
