# RSS Project
This project was created during a Scripting Languages course taught at my uni. It's purpose (for now) is to print the top 5 stories from a given RSS feed.

# Usage
To use the program with a custom URL: python rss_project.py [URL]
To use the program with pre-built URLs: python rss_project.py

# Disclaimer
This project is inspired by the Mr. Robot television series. Feel free to use it as you see fit.
